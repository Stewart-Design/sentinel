    It’s always better to work with a commercial roofing company that also has **general contracting experience**—especially when structural assessments or repairs may be needed. Sentinel Industrial Roofing is a licensed General Contracting Company with experience dating back to **2014**. We understand the critical importance of ensuring your structure is sound **before** installing a new roof. From framing repairs to substrate reinforcement, we have the expertise to identify and address underlying issues—saving time, reducing risk, and ensuring your new roofing system is properly supported for long-term performance.


    We also utilize **drone-based thermal scans** to accurately detect **hidden water damage** and moisture infiltration beneath the roof surface—allowing us to create informed, cost-effective repair plans before roof failure occurs.


    ## Structural Roofing Assessments

    At Sentinel Industrial Roofing, we begin every project with a thorough **structural assessment** of the building to ensure it can support the roofing system long-term. We collaborate directly with **manufacturer engineers** to determine the optimal design—including the type and configuration of **insulation board**, the required **layering system**, and the most effective **single-ply waterproof membrane**. This ensures a durable, code-compliant installation tailored to the specific structural and thermal needs of your facility.


    ## Roof Replacements
    
    At Sentinel Industrial Roofing, roof replacements begin with a **detailed assessment for RMS members**. If the existing roof is not eligible for a cost-saving **spray coating**, we move forward with a full replacement plan tailored to your building’s needs.


    This includes **engineering the system** and specifying the correct **insulation R-value**, **layer configuration**, and **state code compliance**, along with selecting the most suitable **single-ply membrane** for your building type.

    We prioritize:

    - **Long-lasting warranties**

    - **Low maintenance over time**

    - **Energy Star®-rated roofing systems**


    We understand the unique demands of different facilities—whether **manufacturing**, **residential complexes**, **restaurants**, or **high-traffic buildings**—and apply the best materials and designs for each. Our goal is simple: deliver the **right system** for the **right structure**, with maximum performance and efficiency.
