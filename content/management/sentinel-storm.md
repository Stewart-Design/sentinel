  text: >-
    Storm damage isn't always obvious, but can significantly impact your roof's lifespan. Even without visible leaks, wind and hail damage can compromise structural integrity and lead to costly problems down the line. Our comprehensive storm damage assessment finds hidden issues that could qualify for insurance coverage–potentially saving you hundreds of thousands on a complete replacement at little to no cost to you.*
