    Flat roofs can often be restored with a **spray-applied coating system**, but only if the owner acts **before major damage occurs**. This solution is ideal for roofs that are still structurally sound but starting to show signs of wear.
  panels:
    - heading: Cost Savings
      subheading: Roof coatings can save **40–60%** compared to full tear-off and replacement.
      color:
    - heading: Warranty
      subheading: Most systems come with a **20-year manufacturer warranty**, offering long-term peace of mind.
    - heading: Timing is Critical
      subheading: Coating is only an option if applied **before leaks or deterioration become severe**. Waiting too long eliminates this cost-effective option.
  conclusion: For flat roof owners who act early, spray coatings provide a high-performance, long-lasting, and budget-friendly alternative to replacement.
