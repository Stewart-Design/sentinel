      Sentinel Industrial Roofing completed a **60-mil mechanically fastened PVC re-roof** for a 22,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in **Washington, Pennsylvania**. The old TPO roof showed seam failures and ponding from years of freeze-thaw cycles. Our **Washington PA commercial roofing** crew replaced it with a durable PVC membrane built for chemical resistance and long-term waterproofing. The new system meets modern insulation and drainage standards, lowering energy costs and providing dependable performance throughout the **Southwestern PA industrial corridor**.
