      In **Fairmont, West Virginia**, Sentinel Industrial Roofing installed a **60-mil PVC single-ply roof** over an 8,000-square-foot retail property. The former roof had UV cracking and seam separation. Our **Fairmont WV roofing** team replaced it with a reflective PVC membrane to boost waterproofing, energy efficiency, and longevity—ideal for the area’s four-season weather conditions.
