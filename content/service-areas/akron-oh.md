      Sentinel Industrial Roofing completed a 60-mil mechanically fastened PVC re-roof over a 55,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Akron, Ohio. The prior built-up roof suffered from blistering, ponding, and chemical exposure from production exhaust. Our Akron OH commercial roofing crew installed a reinforced PVC membrane engineered for superior chemical and heat resistance, ensuring long-term watertight performance. The new roof increases reflectivity, reduces interior temperatures, and enhances the facility’s energy efficiency for years of dependable operation in Northeast Ohio’s variable climate.
