      Sentinel Industrial Roofing restored a **20,000-square-foot warehouse roof in Morgantown, West Virginia** using a **silicone roof coating** over aging EPDM. After cleaning and reinforcing seams, our **Morgantown commercial roofing team** created a seamless, watertight barrier ideal for the area’s heavy rain and temperature swings. The reflective coating lowered interior temperatures and extended roof life by more than fifteen years, showcasing Sentinel’s expertise in **roof restoration and maintenance** across **North-Central WV**.
