      Sentinel Industrial Roofing completed a **60-mil PVC re-roof** for a 17,000-square-foot shopping center in **Bridgeport, West Virginia**. The old EPDM system had reached end-of-life. Our **Bridgeport commercial roofing** crew installed a new mechanically fastened PVC membrane built for high foot traffic and storm resistance. The project improved drainage, reduced maintenance, and delivered long-term protection for the property owners.
