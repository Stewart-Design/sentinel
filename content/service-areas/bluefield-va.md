      In **Bluefield, Virginia**, Sentinel Industrial Roofing installed a **60-mil PVC single-ply roof** for an 8,200-square-foot restaurant facility. The previous roof suffered grease and heat damage near exhaust vents. Our **Bluefield VA commercial roofing team** chose PVC for its superior grease and chemical resistance, ideal for food-service environments. The project finished ahead of schedule, eliminating leaks and improving the building’s energy efficiency.
