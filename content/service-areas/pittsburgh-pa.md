      In **Pittsburgh, PA**, Sentinel Industrial Roofing installed a **60-mil TPO single-ply roof** over a 140,000-square-foot shopping center. The previous membrane had widespread leaks and seam fatigue. Our **Pittsburgh commercial roofing** specialists mechanically fastened the new white TPO system, improving energy efficiency, reflectivity, and UV protection. The roof now offers long-term durability and reduced cooling costs for tenants across the **Greater Pittsburgh retail district**.
