      Sentinel Industrial Roofing installed a 60-mil mechanically fastened TPO roof system over a 38,000-square-foot distribution facility in Lancaster, Ohio. The existing EPDM roof had multiple membrane splits and failed flashings due to age and thermal movement. Our Lancaster OH commercial roofing team removed wet insulation, improved drainage, and installed a bright white TPO membrane for maximum reflectivity and energy efficiency. The finished system delivers reliable protection for the client’s logistics operations while meeting current building and insulation standards across Central Ohio.
