    We know that your roof is more than a covering; it's the guardian that protects everything underneath it—your people, products, equipment, customer experience, and daily operations.

    
    You may have found your first leak, but it won't be your last. We've seen what happens when roofs are repeatedly patched until it's too late—costly business interruptions lead to hidden structural damage and eventually an unexpected six-figure expense. When it comes to your roof, when it rains, it pours: delaying new launches, slowing expansion plans, and forcing you to divert strategic investments to emergency repairs. Instead of this reactive cycle, our proactive approach helps you get years ahead of these problems with solutions engineered to last a lifetime.

    
    That's why, with over 25 years of general contracting experience, we take a different approach to cover not just what’s on top but what’s underneath. We start with roof assessment that find minor problems before they become major leaks, offer a cost-saving maintenance program that extends your roof's lifespan while investing in future replacement, and back it all with the industry's only 20-year warranty covering both materials AND labor.

    
    While other roofers patch problems, we get it right from day one—because the right roof is the roof that lasts. With SENTINEL, you'll be completely covered, so you never have to think about your roof again.
